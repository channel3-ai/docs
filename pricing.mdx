We want you to make much more money on Channel3 than you spend on it.

We charge per API call, and we take a cut of commissions paid out on our platform.

Our inital cut is 50%, and will reduce as you drive more sales. Please <a href="mailto:support@trychannel3.com">contact us</a> with any questions about pricing.
