When you subscribe to price tracking for a product, you can receive webhook notifications whenever the price changes. Use webhooks to alert your users about deals, update your UI, or trigger other actions in real-time.

Configure your webhook endpoint in the [Channel3 dashboard](https://trychannel3.com/dashboard).

For payload details and event types, see our [webhook event catalog](https://webhooks.trychannel3.com/).
