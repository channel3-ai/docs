## Quickstart
Clone the repo, customize your agent, and generate commission from products your agent sells! 🎉

- **Try out a live demo**: [AI Shopping Assistant Demo](https://shopping-assistant-omega.vercel.app/)
- **Clone the GitHub repo**: [channel3-ai/shopping-assistant](https://github.com/channel3-ai/shopping-assistant)

## Details

The Customizable Shopping Assistant is a simple AI chatbot that uses Channel3 for real-time product search.
It is built with Next.js 16 and the Vercel AI SDK, and displays search results in an interactive product carousel above the chat.

You can ask about products in natural language (for example, "show me linen shirts under $100" or "find running shoes similar to this picture"),
and the agent will call Channel3 under the hood to fetch relevant products.

You can edit `app-config.ts` to customize the agent's personality, theme, and search behavior. Some examples of agents you can build with this repo:
- A Santa Claus agent that helps users find the perfect gift
- A fashion stylist that helps users pick out clothes for a specific occasion
- An expert interior designer that helps users find the perfect furniture for their home

## Key capabilities

- **Natural language product search**: The agent uses Channel3 to search across a large product catalog from free-form queries.
- **Rich product UI**: Search results are rendered in a carousel with images, pricing, and product details.
- **Image-based search**: Users can upload an image to find visually similar products.
- **Built-in monetization**: Channel3 handles affiliate tracking and revenue sharing when users click through and purchase.

## Customizing the agent

You can quickly adapt this demo to your use case without changing the core architecture:

- **Update the app configuration** in `app/app-config.ts` in the demo repo:
  - Change the **model** and provider via the `model` field.
  - Customize **metadata and UI copy** (title, welcome message, input placeholder).
  - Adjust the **agent instructions** to match your brand voice and shopping experience.
- **Tune Channel3 search behavior** via the `search.filters` section in `app/app-config.ts`:
  - Filter by brands, categories, gender, price range, availability, condition, and more.
  - Start broad, then narrow filters as you refine your experience.
- **Extend the agent tools** (for example, to add new actions alongside Channel3 search) by editing the files in the demo repo’s `agent` folder.
