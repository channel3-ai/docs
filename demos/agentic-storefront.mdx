## Details

The Agentic Storefront (Basket) is a Next.js starter that demonstrates AI-powered product search with Channel3. 
It features two distinct search modes:

- **Quick Mode**: Direct text or image search sent straight to Channel3 for instant results.
- **Smart Mode**: AI-assisted search that generates multiple optimized queries, searches in parallel, and deduplicates results for more comprehensive product discovery.

Both modes support image uploads alongside text queries, enabling visual search where users can find products similar to images they provide.

- **Multi-query AI search**: Smart mode generates and executes multiple search variations in parallel for better coverage.
- **Channel3 SDK integration**: Built on `@channel3/sdk` for seamless product catalog access.
