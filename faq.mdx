## How does Channel3 track clicks, views, and sales?

### URL format

```text
https://buy.trychannel3.com/<product_id>-<developer_id>
```

Example:

```text
https://buy.trychannel3.com/12345-67890
```

### What each part means

- **product_id**: The identifier of the product you want a user to buy. You can get this from the Channel3 API or from the Dashboard when viewing a product.
- **developer_id**: Your developer/account identifier so we can attribute commissions and analytics to you.

### Important details

- **One hyphen as the separator**: The single `-` character separates `product_id` and `developer_id`.
- **IDs are opaque**: Use the IDs exactly as issued by Channel3. Do not alter, trim, or reformat them.
- **Case sensitivity**: Treat IDs as case-sensitive. Copy them exactly from the API/Dashboard.

### Where to find these IDs

- **product_id**: Returned by the Search/Product APIs and visible in the Dashboard on product detail.
- **developer_id**: Shown in the Dashboard under developer/account settings and returned by the API where applicable.

### Query parameters

You can append standard marketing parameters (e.g., `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`) to the URL. They will be preserved through the checkout flow.

Example:

```text
https://buy.trychannel3.com/12345-67890?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email
```

### Custom checkout domains

If you have a custom checkout domain configured with Channel3, the same path structure applies. Only the hostname changes.

```text
https://buy.yourdomain.com/<product_id>-<developer_id>
```

### Error handling

- If either ID is invalid or missing, the URL will not resolve and the user will see an error page (e.g., 404 or invalid link).
- If the IDs are valid but the product is unavailable, the page will indicate that the item cannot be purchased.

### Programmatic construction

```js
const productId = "<product_id>";
const developerId = "<developer_id>";
const checkoutUrl = `https://buy.trychannel3.com/${productId}-${developerId}`;
```

Use HTTPS and ensure you URL-encode any values you inject into the URL if they are not plain IDs.

### Quick checklist

- Use the exact `product_id` and `developer_id` you received from Channel3.
- Join them with a single hyphen: `<product_id>-<developer_id>`.
- Prefix with `https://buy.trychannel3.com/` (or your custom checkout domain).
- Optionally add UTM params for attribution.
