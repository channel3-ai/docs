## How does Channel3 track clicks, views, and sales?

When you call the `/search` endpoint, we return results with monetizable, trackable links.

Our product links look like `https://buy.trychannel3.com/{product_id}-{your_unique_id}`.

Every click passes through our edge workers, where we confirm the click is valid (e.g. not a bot), and log it. When we send the end-user to the merchant site, we do so via another link provided by our affiliate partners, who track the sale.

## How do commissions work?

Channel3 partners with established affiliate networks and merchants. When a user clicks your Channel3 link and makes a purchase within the merchant’s attribution window:

- The merchant approves or rejects the commission.
- The affiliate network pays Channel3 once the commission is approved and the return window has passed.
- After funds clear to Channel3, we credit your account balance. We show you estimated payouts in your dashboard so you can see what to expect.

Commissions can be adjusted or canceled by networks or retailers for reasons such as returns, order cancellations, suspected fraud, attribution to another channel, or network quality concerns.

## How does Channel3 make money?

We charge for the `/search` and `/enrich` endpoints on our API. We also take a cut of commission. Our default take rate is 50%, and will decrease as you drive more sales. Please <a href="mailto:support@trychannel3.com">contact us</a> with any questions.

## When will I get paid?

We aim to get you paid as fast as possible.

Due to how merchants and affiliate networks confirm and remit commissions, payments are typically on a net‑90 basis from the transaction date. This timing is industry standard, and we’re actively working with partners to shorten it wherever possible.

To receive a payout, all of the following must be true:

- Your payment details are added and valid in the dashboard.
- The commissions included have been approved by the merchant and paid to Channel3 by our affiliate partners.

What to expect:

- Most merchants confirm and pay within 90–120 days of the transaction.
- Your first payout generally arrives ~3 months after your first qualifying transactions; subsequent payouts occur monthly as additional commissions clear.
- Amounts marked as “Pending” mean they haven’t been confirmed by the merchant/network yet, or they haven’t been paid to Channel3.
