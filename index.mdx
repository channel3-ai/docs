      **Treat your API key like a password!** Don't share it publicly or embed it directly in frontend code that users can see. For browser-based apps, consider a backend proxy. For server-side apps, use environment variables.

## Core API Concepts

While our SDKs handle a lot of the complexity, it's good to know the basics:

-   **Search (`/search` endpoint):** This is your main workhorse. You can send:
    -   `query`: A text string.
    -   `image_url` or `base64_image`: For visual search.
    -   `filters`: To narrow down results (e.g., by color, price).
    -   `limit`: To control how many results you get.
-   **Get Product Details (`/products/{product_id}` endpoint):** Once you have a product ID from a search, use this to get more comprehensive information about it.

Our SDKs provide convenient methods that wrap these endpoints, along with typed models for requests and responses, making your development experience much smoother.
