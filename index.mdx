**What can you do with Channel3?**
-   **Search a Vast Catalog:** Access nearly every product on the web.
-   **Natural Language Search:** Let users search just like they talk (e.g., "warm winter coat for hiking").
-   **Visual Search:** Allow users to find products using an image. Got a photo of cool sneakers? Find similar ones!

      **Treat your API key like a password!** Don't share it publicly or embed it directly in frontend code that users can see. For browser-based apps, consider a backend proxy. For server-side apps, use environment variables.
