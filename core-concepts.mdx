description: Understanding Channel3's core functionality for both MCP and API
---

Channel3 provides two core operations that work identically whether you're using our **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** for AI agents or our **REST API** for applications. The underlying functionality is the same - only the interface differs.

## 1. Search

Search is your main workhorse for finding products. Whether you're building an AI agent or a shopping app, search enables you to:

- **Text Search**: Send natural language queries (e.g., "warm winter coat for hiking")
- **Visual Search**: Find products using images - upload a photo and find similar items
- **Multimodal Search**: Combine text and images for ultra-precise results (e.g., "blue version of this dress" + image)
- **Filtered Search**: Narrow results by price, color, brand, and other attributes

### Key Parameters
- `query`: Text string for what you're looking for
- `image_url` or `base64_image`: For visual search capabilities
- `filters`: To narrow down results (price range, color, etc.)
- `limit`: Control the number of results returned

## 2. Product Detail

Once you have a product from search results, use product detail to get comprehensive information about that specific item.

This gives you:
- Complete product specifications
- High-quality images
- Pricing information
- Availability status
- Purchase links

### Usage
- Input: `product_id` (obtained from search results)
- Output: Full product information and metadata

## MCP vs API: Same Power, Different Interface

Both MCP and API access the exact same underlying Channel3 functionality:

**MCP (for AI Agents)**
- Integrates directly with AI agent frameworks
- Tools are automatically available to your agent
- Perfect for autonomous shopping agents

**REST API (for Applications)**
- Standard HTTP endpoints
- Available via our SDKs or direct API calls
- Ideal for web apps, mobile apps, and custom integrations

The search capabilities, product data, and core functionality are identical - choose the interface that best fits your use case.
