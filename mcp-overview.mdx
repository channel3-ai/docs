## What is the Channel3 MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard that allows AI agents to securely connect to external data sources and tools. Think of it as a bridge that lets your AI assistant access real-world information and take actions beyond just generating text.

The Channel3 MCP specifically gives your AI agents superpowers for product discovery. Your agent can search through millions of real products in real-time, complete with current prices, rich images, detailed descriptions, and real-time availability.

## Why Use an MCP?

**Real-time Data**: Your agents get access to live product information, not stale training data from months ago.

**Enhanced Capabilities**: Transform your AI from a conversational tool into an action-oriented shopping assistant.

**Revenue Generation**: Earn commissions when users purchase products your agent recommends.

**Better User Experience**: Provide specific, actionable recommendations with direct purchase links rather than vague suggestions.

```json Claude Config
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Channel3": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp-server.channel3.workers.dev/sse",
	    "--header",
	    "x-api-key: ${apiKey}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "apiKey": <your-api-key>
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```python OpenAI Agents SDK
from openai.agents import Agent
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStdio

async def main(message: str):
  async with MCPServerStdio(
      name="Channel3 MCP Server",
      cache_tools_list=True,
      params={
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
              "mcp-remote",

              "x-api-key: <your-api-key>"
          ],
      },
  ) as mcp_server:
      print("MCP server connected")
      # Initialize the agent with the MCP server
      shopping_agent = Agent[DemoShoppingContext](
          name="Shopping Agent",
          instructions=(
              "You are a personal shopping assistant. "
              "Help the user find the best products for their needs. "
              "You have access to a tool to search the web for products."
          ),
          output_type=TextResponse,
          model="gpt-4.1-nano",
          # https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/examples/mcp/sse_example/main.py
          mcp_servers=[mcp_server],
      )

      result = Runner.run_streamed(
          shopping_agent,
          input=message,
      )

      for chunk in result:
        print(chunk)

asyncio.run(main("I'm looking for a new laptop"))
```

</CodeGroup>

That's it! Your agent now has access to Channel3's product search capabilities. Start building and watch your AI come to life with real-world shopping superpowers. üõçÔ∏è
