The Channel3 Python SDK, generated with [Stainless](https://www.stainless.com/), provides convenient access to the Channel3 REST API from Python.

## Installation

Install the SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install channel3-sdk
```

## Authentication

You can provide your API key using the `CHANNEL3_API_KEY` environment variable, or by passing it directly to the client.

```python
from channel3_sdk import Channel3, AsyncChannel3

# Initialize with environment variable
client = Channel3()

# Or, initialize with API key directly
client_with_key = Channel3(api_key="your_api_key_here")

# Async client
async_client = AsyncChannel3()
```

## Usage

All top-level endpoints are available as properties on the client. For example, to use the `search` endpoint, you can do the following:

```python
from channel3_sdk import Channel3

client = Channel3()

def main():
    response = client.search.perform(
        query="organic cotton t-shirt"
    )
    print(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Async Usage

```python
import asyncio
from channel3_sdk import AsyncChannel3

client = AsyncChannel3()

async def main():
    response = await client.search.perform(
        query="organic cotton t-shirt"
    )
    print(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Error Handling

When the library is unable to connect to the API, or if the API returns a non-success status code (i.e., 4xx or 5xx response), a subclass of `APIError` will be thrown.

```python
from channel3_sdk import Channel3
from channel3_sdk.errors import APIError

client = Channel3()

def main():
    try:
        client.search.perform()
    except APIError as e:
        print(f"Status code: {e.status_code}")
        print(f"Error name: {e.request.body.get('error', {}).get('type')}")
        print(f"Headers: {e.headers}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Error types are exposed on the `channel3.errors` module.
