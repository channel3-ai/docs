## Getting Started: Your First Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your free Channel3 account">
    First things first, you'll need a Channel3 account. This is where you'll
    manage your API keys, track usage, and more.
    <Card
      title="Create your free Channel3 account"
      icon="user-plus"
      href="https://trychannel3.com/sign-up"
    >
      Use your Google account, GitHub, or email to sign up. If you'd like to add multiple users to your organization, just shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:support@trychannel3.com">support@trychannel3.com</a>
    </Card>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Grab your API key">
    We generated an API key for you when you made your account. Your API key identifies you to Channel3, so we can track your API usage and pay you for the sales you drive.
    <Card
      title="Go to API keys"

      Keep this key safe!
